Place the provided logo image here as `gs-logo.png` (or `gs-war-wagon-logo.png`).

Paths used by the site:
- svg placeholder: assets/branding/gs-war-wagon-logo.svg
- recommended raster logo path to replace: assets/branding/gs-logo.png
- favicon path to replace: assets/branding/gs-favicon.png

You attached a logo file in the chat. Save that file to this folder and name it `gs-logo.png`.
After you place the file here I can update `css/styles.css` to extract a palette and switch the site variables to match.
